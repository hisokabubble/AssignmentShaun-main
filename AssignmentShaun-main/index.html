        <p><b>This is an arcade-retro themed game where players get to control a bird named Faby, which has
          one singular purpose to always move ahead to the right. The player is required to navigate
          Faby up and down through pipes of pipes at a time, that always have gaps that are evenly
          spreaded apart everytime. These gaps are arranged randomly at different heights. Faby, while
          moving right, descends and flies downwards too and it is up to the player to keep it afloat by
          tapping the screen. Everytime Faby passes through a pair of pipes, the player is granted one
          point. Making contact with the pipes or the ground, ends the round. If the player reaches 10
          points or more, he/she gets a bronze medal. 20 points and above awards a silver medal, 30
          points a gold, and a platinum medal for 40 points and above. These medals hold no actual value,
          but rather acts as a sense of accomplishment for the players to work hard for.</b></p></div>

      Creator Dong Nguyen discovered video games by playing Super Mario Bros. when he was young.
      At age 16 he learnt coding on his own, 3 years later, while studying programming in university, he
      won an internship at Punch Entertainment, one of the only gaming companies in Vietnam. He found that
      games such as Angry Birds were too complicated for phone gaming, from then on, he wanted to make a
      much simpler game for people who were always moving around. Nguyen made this game in only 2 to 3
      days. Faby, the bird, was originally designed for a cancelled platform game. Originally the game
      was much easier during development, however, Nguyen felt it was too boring and thus, increased the
      difficulty. He proposed the game be free to download for everyone, but using in-game advertisements
      to make money. Nguyen describes Western games were overly complex, and decided to stick to the
      retro pixalated style for more convenient usage.

            Flappy Bird was first released on the 24th of May, 2013, with support for the Iphone 5, which
            was the most popular phone at the time. The game was then updated for iOs 7 in September of
            the same year to support other models. On launch, the game was unsuccessful, however, popular
            Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie reviewed the game, and that caused players to take notice of the
            game and soon, download numbers drastically increased. In January 2014, Flappy Bird topped
            the Charts in App stores for the US and China, and later on, the UK app store, nicknamed
            "The New Angry Birds". It ended off the month of January as the most downloaded app in the
            App Store. On the same month, Flappy Bird was released to the Android world and the Google
            Play store. Through the in-game advertisements method, the game was earning $50,000 a day
            in revenue, thus deeming that plan successful.</b></div>

    <div><b>Flappy Bird received mixed and average reviews from critics. From seven reviews only, the
      game had a Metacritic score of only 52/100. The app was criticized for having an insanely
      irritating, difficult and frustrating feel, which also combines bad, boring graphics and jerky
      movement with a steep difficulty curve. IGN scored the game 5.4/10, adding that the game was as
      addictive as it was shallow. Despite giving bad comments about the game, IGN noted that such
      gameplay was "an addictive short-term distraction" for casual players. Many people say the game
      was too difficult, with one player stating that it took him half an hour to achieve 5 points.
      Creators of similar games defended the game by saying, "simple games are more satisfying." Flappy
      Bird had both good and bad reviews, the good mainly coming from those who can appreciate the game,
      and the bad from those who do not know or are not good at the game.
