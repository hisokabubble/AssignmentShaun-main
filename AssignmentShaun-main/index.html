        <p>Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves 
        persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that 
        have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends 
        when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the
        player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. During the game over
        screen, the player is awarded a bronze medal if they reached ten or more points, a 
        silver medal from twenty points, a gold medal from thirty points, and a platinum medal from forty
        points</p></div>

        Dong Nguyen grew up in Vạn Phúc, a village near Hanoi. He discovered video games by playing
        Super Mario Bros. as a child and began coding his own at age 16. At 19, while studying
        programming at a local university, he won an internship at Punch Entertainment,
        one of the few video game companies in Vietnam. While using the iPhone, he found that its most
        popular games such as Angry Birds were too complicated, and wanted to make a simpler game for
        people who are "always on the move". Flappy Bird was created and developed by Nguyen in two to
        three days. The bird character, Faby, was originally designed in 2012 for a cancelled platform
        game. The gameplay was inspired by the act of bouncing a ping pong ball against a paddle for as
        long as possible. Initially the game was significantly easier than it became in the final version,
        however Nguyen said he found this version to be boring and subsequently tightened up the
        difficulty. He described the business plan of a free download with in-game advertisements as
        "very common in the Japanese market". Nguyen believes that contemporary Western games are overly
        complex. His company, .Gears, describes its games as "heavily influenced by retro pixelated
        games in its golden age. Everything is pure, extremely hard and incredibly fun to play".

        Flappy Bird was originally released on May 24, 2013, with support for the iPhone 5.
        The game was subsequently updated for iOS 7 in September 2013. Although originally unsuccessful,
        the game received a massive influx of players after being reviewed by the Swedish YouTuber
        PewDiePie. In January 2014, it topped the Free Apps chart in the US and Chinese App Stores,
        and later that month topped the same section of the UK App Store where it was touted as
        "the new Angry Birds".It ended January as the most downloaded App on the App Store.
        The Android version of Flappy Bird was released to the Google Play store on January 30, 2014.
        In early 2014, Nguyen said in an interview with The Verge that the game was earning around
        $50,000 a day in revenue through its in-game advertising.</article>

    <article id="reception">Flappy Bird received "mixed or average reviews" from critics, holding a Metacritic score
        of 52/100, based on seven reviews. The app was criticized by the Huffington Post, which described
        it as an "insanely irritating, difficult and frustrating game which combines a super-steep
        difficulty curve with bad, boring graphics and jerky movement". IGN gave the game a mediocre
        score of 5.4 out of 10, quipping that the game is as addictive as it was shallow. Despite
        criticizing its playability and its "no skill" requirement, IGN noted that the gameplay made it
        "an addictive short-term distraction" for the casual skill and score-obsessed players. The game's
        difficulty has been a source of ire for many users, with one user stating that it took him half
        an hour to achieve a score of five points. According to its creator, the game is slightly easier
        on Android devices than on iOS. Nolan Bushnell, the creator of the video game Pong,
        compared Flappy Bird to his own game by claiming that "simple games are more satisfying".
        John Romero, a co-creator of the classic first-person shooter Doom, commented that Flappy Bird is
        "a reaction against prevailing design the way grunge was a reaction to metal."
