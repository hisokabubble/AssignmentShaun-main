## Flappy Bird ~

This website is made for the game Flappy Bird, which is an arcade-retro themed game consisting of a bird
and pipes that requires players to control and fly the bird through the pipes to obtain the highest score
that they can achieve.

This website aims to inform people who have never gotten the chance to play the game when it was out, a chance to learn the history about the game and what the game has gone through. And for players who were fortunate enough to play the game years ago, a chance to relive those memories and play the game.

## Design Process ~

My rationale for this website is to make it very very simple to see so as to match the theme of the original game, which was a simplistic vibe.

I wanted the Navbar to be sticky so that users can easily navigate the site using the Navbar no matter which part of the site they were on.

Buttons of the Navbar were made very very huge so that everyone can easily see what the writings are.

The FlappyBird logo is a button to the home page.

Home is a button to the home page with a dropdown menu consisting of the different sections of the homepage.

Play is a link to another website where users can play the game.

Leaderboard is a link to another website where users can see the top Flappy Bird players.

Support Us is meant to be a sign up form so users can donate or sign up for newsletters for daily Flappy Bird facts or jokes.

Contact Us would be for the creators of the site to put links to their socials.

## Features ~

I made the Navbar sticky and it shows up on every page except the Play and Leaderboard pages which are links to an external site not related to the assignment.

I made a drop down menu for the Home button so that users can skip to sections that they want to read instead of needing them to scroll down all the time, and with the sticky Navbar, if users want to go back to the top, they can do so as well.

Play and Leaderboards are meant to be a code for the actual game, which I am not doing, but if I were to make an actual site for the Flappy Bird game, I would code my own Flappy Bird game and Leaderboard and link it to my site. But for now, I link it to an external site.

Support Us will consist of a form that users can sign up for daily notifications about the Game, or allow users to offer their donations to help support the game, which in an actual site, the donations would have been used to keep the code or game alive if I had actually coded it.

Contact Us just consists of Buttons/ Icons linking to a social media page regarding Flappy Bird.

## Description and explanation ~

The color theme was simplistic so as I did not want the website to be very hard to read. The main purpose of the site was to provide information about the history and development of the game, which means that there are many passages of texts, thus, I went with a more simplistic coloring design and did not want to use many pictures.

For the Navbar, I chose a standard black to blue gradient can I thought just a basic black would be way too simplistic, even though I was going for such a theme, I still did not want the website to seem super plain and boring. Simplistic is not the same as plain. The gradient sideways represent the sequence as to which the users would read the contents of the Navbar, which starts from the logo, to the Contact us; from left to right.

For the background color, I went with a purple to green gradient downwards as it relates to the theme of the game. Green is the main color used in the game, and the gradient downwards is significant to the game as the whole purpose of the game is to prevent the bird from reaching the ground. A gradient downwards also synchronizes with scrolling down, so as users scroll down for more information, the background color changes so it does not look like they are just reading repetitive texts and long passages.
